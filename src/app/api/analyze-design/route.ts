The overall mood is confident yet approachable — a balance of modern minimalism with intentional craft details. Subtle grain textures and soft shadows add depth without clutter.",

        "Primary: A modern geometric sans-serif (similar to Inter or Satoshi) used at large display sizes with tight letter-spacing for headlines. Body text uses the same family at regular weight with generous line-height (1.6–1.7) for readability. Strong typographic hierarchy with 3–4 distinct size steps.",
      layout:
        "Clean 12-column grid with asymmetric hero sections. Content is left-aligned with right-side negative space creating visual tension. Cards and containers use generous internal padding (24–32px) and subtle 1px borders. Vertical rhythm is consistent with 8px base unit.",
      spacing:
        "Very generous — section padding of 80–120px vertically. Component spacing follows a strict 8/16/24/32/48px scale. The whitespace is used as a design element itself, giving the layout a premium, unhurried feel.",
      standoutDetails:
        "Subtle noise/grain texture overlay on background surfaces. Micro-interactions on hover states with smooth 300ms transitions. Accent color used sparingly — only for CTAs and key interactive elements. A single decorative gradient blur orb in the hero area adds visual interest without distraction.",

    readyToUsePrompt:
      'Create a modern, editorial-style landing page design with a warm-neutral color palette anchored by deep ink black (#1A1A2E), warm ivory (#FAF5EF), and indigo accent (#6366F1). Use a geometric sans-serif typeface (Inter or Satoshi) with bold display headings at 48–64px, tight letter-spacing, and regular-weight body text at 16–18px with generous line-height. Layout should follow a 12-column grid with asymmetric compositions, heavy use of whitespace as a design element, and section padding of 80–120px. Cards should have subtle 1px borders, rounded corners (12–16px radius), and soft drop shadows. Include a single decorative gradient blur orb in the hero section. Apply a subtle grain/noise texture overlay to background surfaces. All hover states should have smooth 300ms transitions. Accent color should be used sparingly — only for primary CTAs and interactive highlights. The overall mood should feel confident, premium, and approachable — like a high-end SaaS product or design studio portfolio.',
